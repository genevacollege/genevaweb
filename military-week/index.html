			<h2>Military Appreciation Week at Geneva College</h2>
			<p>
				<span>
					<strong>Geneva College has a proud history of supporting our military and veteran community.</strong> That support continues today as Geneva is honored to serve military servicemembers, veterans, National Guard, reservists, and their dependents during Military Week.
					<br />
					<br />We are excited to announce our second annual Military Ball, Veterans Breakfast, and Military Tailgate as part of our Military Week events. 
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Geneva College Military Ball will observe the valued traditions of our branches, followed by keynote speaker,&#160;
					<strong>LTC Tommy Richardson,&#160;Commander, Seal Team 10</strong>, traditional toasts and the ceremonial cutting of the cake. The evening will continue with music provided by locally favored DJ John Nerone.
